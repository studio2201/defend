## [0.1.21] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **Rebrand to studio2201**: README, container labels, docker-compose, and Cargo
  metadata now reference `studio2201/defend`. CI badge URL and GHCR image name
  updated accordingly.
- **Fixed SCAN_ env-var copy-paste** in `docker-compose.yml`: all `SCAN_*`
  environment variables renamed to `DEFEND_*` (data path, PIN, allowed origins,
  base URL, site title). Defend now correctly uses its own env-var namespace.
- **Fixed manifest description typo** ("defendner" → "defender") and aligned
  wording with the README tagline.
- **Favicon cache-bust query** bumped `?v=0.1.0` → `?v=0.1.21` in
  `frontend/index.html` to invalidate stale PWA icon cache.
